Additionally, the company will give a one-time recognition bonus of $200.00 to its frontline store and distribution center hourly workers for their efforts during the coronavirus pandemic.

Additionally, starting this week, Target is also offering a new healthcare benefit that provides access to free virtual healthcare visits through the end of the year, regardless of whether team members are on a Target health insurance plan. The company also announced additional extensions of a 30-day paid leave for vulnerable team members, as well as free backup care for family members.

“In the best of times, our team brings incredible energy and empathy to our work, and in harder times they bring those qualities plus extraordinary resilience and agility to keep,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. “Everything we aspire to do and be as a company builds on the central role our team members play.”",POS,https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/target-raises-minimum-wage-to-15/

15-year-old Max Melia designed and developed a wearable wristband which alerts users whenever they are about to touch their face

He first came up with the brilliant idea two years ago as a means of reducing the spread of the cold and flu. After both of Max’s parents contracted COVID-19 four months ago, however, he threw all his efforts into developing a working prototype.
“Watching this pandemic unfold on the news, it was clear the devastating effect it was having on people lives’ across the world,” says Max. “However, it wasn’t until I saw the severity of the virus first-hand, when my parents both contracted COVID-19, did I truly appreciate just what we were dealing with.”

The tech-savvy English teen has since produced the VybPro, which warns users whenever they are about to subconsciously touch their face.

4,"Making catalysts to convert waste carbon dioxide into useful industrial products has been expensive and complicated – until now. Australian engineers have shown it’s as easy as playing with Lego.

Chemical engineers from UNSW Sydney have developed new technology that helps convert harmful carbon dioxide emissions into chemical building blocks to make useful industrial products like fuel and plastics.

And if adopted on a large scale, the process could give the world breathing space as it transitions towards a green economy.


In a paper published today in the journal Advanced Energy Materials, Dr Rahman Daiyan and Dr Emma Lovell from UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering detail a way of creating nanoparticles that promote conversion of waste carbon dioxide into useful industrial components.

The researchers, who carried out their work in the Particles and Catalysis Research Laboratory led by Scientia Professor Rose Amal, show that by making zinc oxide at very high temperatures using a technique called flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), they can create nanoparticles which act as the catalyst for turning carbon dioxide into ‘syngas’ – a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide used in the manufacture of industrial products. The researchers say this method is cheaper and more scalable to the requirements of heavy industry than what is available today.",POS,https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/engineers-convert-co2-emissions-into-chemical-building-blocks-for-fuel/
5,"An Austrian farmer has experienced a trailblazing “eureka moment” on how to grow vegetables throughout the winter—and he is now teaching his technique to other European gardening communities as well.

According to a recent interview with Reasons to Be Cheerful, horticulturist Wolfgang Palme says he accidentally discovered his “winter farming” technique after a batch of his Asian lettuce was left undamaged by an early frost in the vegetable fields behind his house in Lower Austria.

The temperature had dropped to -11º Celsius (12º Fahrenheit), and although the crop is generally frost-resistant to temperatures of -3 or so, the lettuce—and Palme’s other vegetables—had survived the cold.

Palme, who is head of the Research Institute of Horticulture in Austria, was puzzled by the agricultural phenomenon. Upon doing some digging on why his vegetables may have survived the cold snap, the horticulturist found that the existing scientific literature on the frost-hardiness of Central European vegetables was just wrong… so he started to make it right.",POS,https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/farmer-writes-guide-on-farming-vegetables-in-winter/
6,"Some unlikely heroes in Minneapolis have raised $100,000 to support black-owned businesses and neighborhoods—and they’re only 9-years-old.

It all started one day when Kamryn Johnson and five of her friends were bored. So, in order to have a little bit of fun, they had the bright idea to sell some bracelets. Rather than just keep the money for themselves, Kamryn’s mom suggested it would be nice to do something positive for others—and the kids agreed. “Kamryn & Friends: Bracelets for Unity and Justice” was born.

The kiddos hoped to make a small impact with their enterprise, but since May 30, these altruistic children have managed to raise almost $100,000.

Just in time for Father’s Day in the U.S., Kamryn’s dad is super proud.

“She made over $800 the first day,” her dad, former NFL player Ron Johnson, told WCCO News. “She has blisters on her fingers now; she’s been working hard.”

Small business owners in Minneapolis have been hit hard in recent months. First, the coronavirus pandemic shut them down for more than a month.

7,"Senate Republicans have introduced a large bill of police reform called the JUSTICE Act  that includes measures to improve reporting, increase penalties for officers falsifying police reports, offer funding for additional training programs in de-escalation and non-violent policing, and to create a new Criminal Justice Commission that will continually make recommendations on how to reform every level of the criminal justice system with the citizen’s safety and rights as the central consideration.

In the wake of everything that’s happened since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, state and now federal legislatures have been listening to the petitions of millions of Americans asking for more police accountability, less violence in policing, fewer laws which create discriminatory policing, and more.

Good News Network has already reported on the introduction and passage of laws in both Colorado and in Kentucky that increase police accountability, and ban “no-knock” police warrants, respectively.

At the federal level, House Libertarian Justin Amash has introduced, along with Democratic support, a bill that would roll back the doctrine of qualified immunity, which makes it extremely difficult for a private citizen to bring a police officer up on charges for rights violations.

The JUSTICE Act goes quite a bit further than that, albeit in a different direction. Created by African American Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and 46 other co-sponsors from the right side of the isle, the JUSTICE Act is a large piece of police reform with an aim to “improve and reform policing practices, accountability and transparency”.

“Now is the time for reform,” Senator Scott said on his website. “The murder of George Floyd and its aftermath made clear from sea to shining sea that action must be taken to rebuild lost trust between communities of color and law enforcement.”",POS,https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-police-reform-bill-in-the-senate-looks-to-increase-accountability-and-promote-de-escalation/

9,"Prevention has been the name of the game in the coronavirus pandemic thus far. Testing has saved many lives, but there have been no known life-saving treatments for those with respiratory complications from the virus—until now.

Researchers at Oxford University in the UK announced last week that a low-dose steroid treatment—which costs about $6 per dose and is widely available—can reduce the risk of death by one-third for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those on oxygen.

“It’s a major breakthrough,” the chief investigator, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases Peter Horby, told the BBC. “This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality—and it reduces it significantly.”

Doctors typically use the drug, called dexamethasone, to reduce inflammation in their patients. It is an effective treatment for a wide range of conditions, including asthma, arthritis, and even some skin problems. It seems to help coronavirus patients by reducing the damage of cytokine storms, a condition where the immune system goes into overdrive and attacks healthy tissue as it tries to fight the virus.

“It is fantastic that the first treatment demonstrated to reduce mortality is one that is instantly available and affordable worldwide,” wrote Prof. Martin Landry, another lead researcher, in a press release.

Called the RECOVERY trial (Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY), the study, which involved 175 hospitals across the whole of the UK, found no outstanding adverse events from the 10-day treatment given to 2104 patients in the randomized trial of over 6400 infected patients, investigators said.

The Outdoors Act creates a fund into which not less than 50% of all revenues made from energy production on public lands—from oil and gas drilling and renewables—to be dedicated to finally funding over $20 billion worth of delayed maintenance projects in America’s national parks and public lands.

70% of the fund’s contents will go to the National Parks Service for projects in America’s national parks, encompassing over 400 places of historic, recreational, and scientific importance, from the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone to the Appomattox Courthouse and Statue of Liberty.

The pair exchanged words and the man left the store only to come back moments later and start a physical altercation with Deutsch, the sheriff’s office said. The man beat Deutsch as he fell to the floor and he drove off in a dark-colored Chrysler 300 with tinted windows.

Deutsch, of Orland Park, refused medical treatment at the scene and didn’t identify the suspect to detectives who spoke to him after the attack, the sheriff’s office said.

His injuries worsened and he was hospitalized on June 14, the sheriff’s office said. He died at Palos Community Hospital on June 17.

An autopsy found he died of an accumulation of blood in his chest caused by broken ribs from an assault, the Cook County medical examiner’s office said. His death was ruled a homicide.

26,"In one of the shocking incidents, a man after killing his wife in Bengaluru flew to Kolkata and shot dead his mother-in-law on Monday (June 22) and later committed suicide by shooting himself. 

Reportedly, Amit Agarwal aged 42 who is a son-in-law of Subhas and Lalita Dhandhania came to his in-law's flat at RK Samadhi Road in Kolkata around 5:30 PM on Monday and started arguing with them. 

Amit's mother-in-law tried to quell his anger, whose relationship with her wife Shilpi had soured from the past 2 years and a divorce suit was also pending.

He then shot his mother-in-law during the argument. 

His father-in-law survived as he somehow locked the room and sought help from the Phoolbagan Police Station.

Police rushed to the place and entered the flat where Amit was found dead in a pool of blood and a firearm was also recovered from the spot. 

A suicide note was found where it was mentioned that he had killed his wife in Bengaluru before coming to Kolkata.

Kolkata Police immediately contacted the DCP of Whitefield in Bengaluru who hurried to the mentioned spot and found the dead body of Amit's wife.

28,"A new study by Duke University show a substantial increase in heat-related fatalities in Texas by the year 2100 given the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions. These heat-trapping gases are contributing to the rise in global temperatures, a shifting climate and, as a result, more extreme heat events.

Heat is the #1 weather killer
On average, heat is the deadliest weather hazard here in the U.S., killing an estimated 12,000 people every year. That’s more than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.

As noted in the study, hospitals and health care providers do not always report heat-related illnesses or heat as an underlying cause of a death, making it hard to measure the actual impact of extreme heat on health.

Effects of climate change
With increased emissions of greenhouse gases (via industry, transportation, electricity, etc.) more heat is being trapped in the atmosphere. Think of greenhouse gases as a blanket around Earth — increase the concentration of those gases (thicker blanket), more heat gets trapped and the Earth warms. The temperature of our Earth is in fact rising. Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit – a major feat considering how much heat the ocean can absorb and how much is reflected back into space.

According to the study performed by Duke University, heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 9,300 by the year 2100 if no cut in current greenhouse emissions is made. This surpasses initial projections made by the National Climate Assessment in 2018 by a factor of 10. That number drops to 3,900 fatalities by 2100 only if the warming is limited to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (+1.6 degrees).

Given Texas’ population of close to 30 million people and a rate of over 200 deaths per million, this would put our state on track to see over 5,800 people dying from heat-related causes annually, 80 years from now. (In 2019, just over 700 people died from heat-related causes in Texas.)

Complications with COVID-19
Research shows that over 80% of those dying from a heat-related cause are over the age of 60. Unfortunately, the same population more susceptible to heat-related illness/death is the same population more susceptible to COVID-19. Given the ongoing pandemic, the concern for the elderly rises as many are forgoing visits or wellness checks in an effort to social distance. In addition, the loss of jobs due to COVID-19 may put a strain on affording utilities like air conditioning.",NEG,https://www.kxan.com/weather/heat-related-fatalities-projected-to-significantly-increase-with-climate-change/
29,"Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday as the increasing number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases dampened expectations of an economic recovery.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 710.16 points, or 2.7%, to 25,445.94. The S&P 500 closed 2.6% lower at 3,050.33 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 9,909.17. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first daily decline in nine sessions.  It was the worst day for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq since June 11.

Florida said its confirmed cases jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a record, and now total 109,014. The state also said its positivity rate rose to 15.91% from 10.82%. Stocks fell to their session lows after Florida reported its latest case figures.  At one point, the Dow had fallen more than 800 points on Wednesday.

California is one of the states that has also seen a dramatic spike in cases, adding a record of more than 7,000 in one day on Tuesday. In Texas, the Covid-19 number of Covid-19 cases jumped by 5,489. Meanwhile, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ordered visitors from certain hotspot states to quarantine for 14 days.

“The latest coronavirus news is not positive for the stock market which was betting the worst of the pandemic recession was behind us,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. “All the hopes of investors looking for a better economy to improve the bottom lines of companies shut down in the recession have been dashed. Forget about the fears of the virus coming back in the fall, the number of new cases and hospitalizations in states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida says the threat is happening right now.”

Shares of companies primed to benefit from the economy reopening faltered. United Airlines fell 8.3%. Delta, American and Southwest all slid over 7%. Airlines were especially hit by the quarantine orders issued by New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 

“It’s definitely the reason for the last leg down. Airline stocks and transports are down, and oil tanked,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “The regional quarantine sparked concerns about a dampening of activity as the economy in the region is just reopening.”

Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean were lower by 11.1%, 12.4% and 11.3%, respectively. Retailer Gap also fell 7.8%. Disney, meanwhile, declined by 3.9% after its Orlando theme-park workers petitioned to postpone the reopening amid the spike in cases in Florida.
