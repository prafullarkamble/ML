The 15-year-old was shot in his leg, chest and abdomen. He was taken to Stroger Hospital and pronounced dead. The other boy, 16, was hit in the ankle and also taken to Stroger. He was in fair condition.\\n\\nSaturday night, a 13-year-old girl was killed and two other teens were wounded in Austin on the West Side.\\n\\nThe girl was inside a home about 8:30 p.m. in the 1000 block of North LeClaire Avenue when the shots were fired, and she was struck in the neck, police said.

Shops in the state will be shut tomorrow in protest against what the family of father-son pair alleges was police brutality in jail.  \\nFamily members of the store owners - Jayaraj and his son Pennis -- have refused to accept their bodies after the post-mortem last night. They allege that there were injuries to the rectum and other tell-tale signs of torture on the two bodies, and have demanded murder charges against the policemen involved.\\n\\n\"It's a twin murder. There has been inexplicable torture, which as a woman I can't even describe. We will not collect the bodies until murder cases are filed against them (police),\" said Jayaraj's daughter  Persis. \\n\\nJayaraj and his son, who ran a mobile phone store in Santhankulam, were arrested on Friday. \\n\\nAccording to a First Information Report filed on the basis of a police complaint, the two men rolled on the ground and that is how they suffered internal injuries. They were also accused of throwing abuses at the police and threatening to kill them. Charges against them include criminal intimidation, defiance and abuse.\\n\\nThe family alleges that the men were kept in the police station all night and tortured till the next morning, when they were to appear before a Magistrate. \\n\\nAt the sub-jail where the store owners were kept, Pennis, the son, first complained of chest pain. He died in hospital. His father, who complained of severe fever, was also shifted to hospital, where he died. Tuticorin police chief Arun Balagopalan told NDTV: \"We have ordered a probe\".\\n\\nThe Madurai bench of the Madras High Court, which took up the case, has ordered a post-mortem by three government doctors, which will be videographed.\\n\\nChief Minister E Palaniswami, who heads the police force, has announced Rs 20 lakh to each family and a government job for a family member.\\n\\nThough he condoled the deaths, his statement was silent on the allegations of police torture. The government, he says, will abide by the High Court order.\\n\\nOpposition DMK MP Kanimozhi, who represents Tuticorin, has complained to the police chief and demanded action.\\n\\nHuman Rights group People's Watch has even pointed fingers at the Magistrate. Henri Tiphagne of the group says: \"Our enquiry sadly reveals the Judicial Magistrate had not personally met the men before they were remanded. They were hidden in the van. This is contrary to law. Had he met them, they could have narrated what happened and showed the injuries as a result of torture\".\\n\\nA few years ago, the police in Tuticorin came under scrutiny over firing that killed 13 anti-Sterlite protestors.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A new study by Duke University show a substantial increase in heat-related fatalities in Texas by the year 2100 given the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions. These heat-trapping gases are contributing to the rise in global temperatures, a shifting climate and, as a result, more extreme heat events.\\n\\nHeat is the #1 weather killer\\nOn average, heat is the deadliest weather hazard here in the U.S., killing an estimated 12,000 people every year. That’s more than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.\\n\\nAs noted in the study, hospitals and health care providers do not always report heat-related illnesses or heat as an underlying cause of a death, making it hard to measure the actual impact of extreme heat on health.\\n\\nEffects of climate change\\nWith increased emissions of greenhouse gases (via industry, transportation, electricity, etc.) more heat is being trapped in the atmosphere. Think of greenhouse gases as a blanket around Earth — increase the concentration of those gases (thicker blanket), more heat gets trapped and the Earth warms. The temperature of our Earth is in fact rising. Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit – a major feat considering how much heat the ocean can absorb and how much is reflected back into space.\\n\\nAccording to the study performed by Duke University, heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 9,300 by the year 2100 if no cut in current greenhouse emissions is made. This surpasses initial projections made by the National Climate Assessment in 2018 by a factor of 10. That number drops to 3,900 fatalities by 2100 only if the warming is limited to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (+1.6 degrees).\\n\\nGiven Texas’ population of close to 30 million people and a rate of over 200 deaths per million, this would put our state on track to see over 5,800 people dying from heat-related causes annually, 80 years from now. (In 2019, just over 700 people died from heat-related causes in Texas.)\\n\\nComplications with COVID-19\\nResearch shows that over 80% of those dying from a heat-related cause are over the age of 60. Unfortunately, the same population more susceptible to heat-related illness/death is the same population more susceptible to COVID-19. Given the ongoing pandemic, the concern for the elderly rises as many are forgoing visits or wellness checks in an effort to social distance. In addition, the loss of jobs due to COVID-19 may put a strain on affording utilities like air conditioning.</td>\n",

The S&amp;P 500 closed 2.6% lower at 3,050.33 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 9,909.17. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first daily decline in nine sessions.  It was the worst day for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq since June 11.\\n\\nFlorida said its confirmed cases jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a record, and now total 109,014. The state also said its positivity rate rose to 15.91% from 10.82%. Stocks fell to their session lows after Florida reported its latest case figures.  At one point, the Dow had fallen more than 800 points on Wednesday.\\n\\nCalifornia is one of the states that has also seen a dramatic spike in cases, adding a record of more than 7,000 in one day on Tuesday. In Texas, the Covid-19 number of Covid-19 cases jumped by 5,489. Meanwhile, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ordered visitors from certain hotspot states to quarantine for 14 days.\\n\\n“The latest coronavirus news is not positive for the stock market which was betting the worst of the pandemic recession was behind us,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. “All the hopes of investors looking for a better economy to improve the bottom lines of companies shut down in the recession have been dashed. Forget about the fears of the virus coming back in the fall, the number of new cases and hospitalizations in states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida says the threat is happening right now.”\\n\\nShares of companies primed to benefit from the economy reopening faltered. United Airlines fell 8.3%. Delta, American and Southwest all slid over 7%. Airlines were especially hit by the quarantine orders issued by New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. \\n\\n“It’s definitely the reason for the last leg down. Airline stocks and transports are down, and oil tanked,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “The regional quarantine sparked concerns about a dampening of activity as the economy in the region is just reopening.”\\n\\nCarnival, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean were lower by 11.1%, 12.4% and 11.3%, respectively. Retailer Gap also fell 7.8%. Disney, meanwhile, declined by 3.9% after its Orlando theme-park workers petitioned to postpone the reopening amid the spike in cases in Florida. \\n</td>\n",

       "4   An Austrian farmer has experienced a trailblazing “eureka moment” on how to grow vegetables throughout the winter—and he is now teaching his technique to other European gardening communities as well.\\n\\nAccording to a recent interview with Reasons to Be Cheerful, horticulturist Wolfgang Palme says he accidentally discovered his “winter farming” technique after a batch of his Asian lettuce was left undamaged by an early frost in the vegetable fields behind his house in Lower Austria.\\n\\nThe temperature had dropped to -11º Celsius (12º Fahrenheit), and although the crop is generally frost-resistant to temperatures of -3 or so, the lettuce—and Palme’s other vegetables—had survived the cold.\\n\\nPalme, who is head of the Research Institute of Horticulture in Austria, was puzzled by the agricultural phenomenon.

The money raised by Kamryn and her friends will deliver welcome aid to those trying to get back on their feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "6   Senate Republicans have introduced a large bill of police reform called the JUSTICE Act  that includes measures to improve reporting, increase penalties for officers falsifying police reports, offer funding for additional training programs in de-escalation and non-violent policing, and to create a new Criminal Justice Commission that will continually make recommendations on how to reform every level of the criminal justice system with the citizen’s safety and rights as the central consideration.\\n\\nIn the wake of everything that’s happened since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, state and now federal legislatures have been listening to the petitions of millions of Americans asking for more police accountability, less violence in policing, fewer laws which create discriminatory policing, and more.\\n\\nGood News Network has already reported on the introduction and passage of laws in both Colorado and in Kentucky that increase police accountability, and ban “no-knock” police warrants, respectively.\\n\\nAt the federal level, House Libertarian Justin Amash has introduced, along with Democratic support, a bill that would roll back the doctrine of qualified immunity, which makes it extremely difficult for a private citizen to bring a police officer up on charges for rights violations.\\n\\nThe JUSTICE Act goes quite a bit further than that, albeit in a different direction.

       "8   Prevention has been the name of the game in the coronavirus pandemic thus far. Testing has saved many lives, but there have been no known life-saving treatments for those with respiratory complications from the virus—until now.\\n\\nResearchers at Oxford University in the UK announced last week that a low-dose steroid treatment—which costs about $6 per dose and is widely available—can reduce the risk of death by one-third for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those on oxygen.\\n\\n“It’s a major breakthrough,” the chief investigator, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases Peter Horby, told the BBC. “This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality—and it reduces it significantly.”\\n\\nDoctors typically use the drug, called dexamethasone, to reduce inflammation in their patients.

       "19  The death in police custody of a father and son arrested last Friday for keeping their mobile phone shop in Tuticorin open beyond permitted hours has led to anger across Tamil Nadu. Shops in the state will be shut tomorrow in protest against what the family of father-son pair alleges was police brutality in jail.  \\nFamily members of the store owners - Jayaraj and his son Pennis -- have refused to accept their bodies after the post-mortem last night. They allege that there were injuries to the rectum and other tell-tale signs of torture on the two bodies, and have demanded murder charges against the policemen involved.\\n\\n\"It's a twin murder. There has been inexplicable torture, which as a woman I can't even describe. We will not collect the bodies until murder cases are filed against them (police),\" said Jayaraj's daughter  Persis. \\n\\nJayaraj and his son, who ran a mobile phone store in Santhankulam, were arrested on Friday. \\n\\nAccording to a First Information Report filed on the basis of a police complaint, the two men rolled on the ground and that is how they suffered internal injuries. They were also accused of throwing abuses at the police and threatening to kill them. Charges against them include criminal intimidation, defiance and abuse.\\n\\nThe family alleges that the men were kept in the police station all night and tortured till the next morning, when they were to appear before a Magistrate. \\n\\nAt the sub-jail where the store owners were kept, Pennis, the son, first complained of chest pain. He died in hospital. His father, who complained of severe fever, was also shifted to hospital, where he died. Tuticorin police chief Arun Balagopalan told NDTV: \"We have ordered a probe\".\\n\\nThe Madurai bench of the Madras High Court, which took up the case, has ordered a post-mortem by three government doctors, which will be videographed.\\n\\nChief Minister E Palaniswami, who heads the police force, has announced Rs 20 lakh to each family and a government job for a family member.\\n\\nThough he condoled the deaths, his statement was silent on the allegations of police torture. The government, he says, will abide by the High Court order.\\n\\nOpposition DMK MP Kanimozhi, who represents Tuticorin, has complained to the police chief and demanded action.\\n\\nHuman Rights group People's Watch has even pointed fingers at the Magistrate. Henri Tiphagne of the group says: \"Our enquiry sadly reveals the Judicial Magistrate had not personally met the men before they were remanded. They were hidden in the van. This is contrary to law. Had he met them, they could have narrated what happened and showed the injuries as a result of torture\".\\n\\nA few years ago, the police in Tuticorin came under scrutiny over firing that killed 13 anti-Sterlite protestors.   \n",

       "27  A new study by Duke University show a substantial increase in heat-related fatalities in Texas by the year 2100 given the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions. These heat-trapping gases are contributing to the rise in global temperatures, a shifting climate and, as a result, more extreme heat events.\\n\\nHeat is the #1 weather killer\\nOn average, heat is the deadliest weather hazard here in the U.S., killing an estimated 12,000 people every year. That’s more than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.\\n\\nAs noted in the study, hospitals and health care providers do not always report heat-related illnesses or heat as an underlying cause of a death, making it hard to measure the actual impact of extreme heat on health.\\n\\nEffects of climate change\\nWith increased emissions of greenhouse gases (via industry, transportation, electricity, etc.) more heat is being trapped in the atmosphere. Think of greenhouse gases as a blanket around Earth — increase the concentration of those gases (thicker blanket), more heat gets trapped and the Earth warms. The temperature of our Earth is in fact rising. Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit – a major feat considering how much heat the ocean can absorb and how much is reflected back into space.\\n\\nAccording to the study performed by Duke University, heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 9,300 by the year 2100 if no cut in current greenhouse emissions is made. This surpasses initial projections made by the National Climate Assessment in 2018 by a factor of 10. That number drops to 3,900 fatalities by 2100 only if the warming is limited to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (+1.6 degrees).\\n\\nGiven Texas’ population of close to 30 million people and a rate of over 200 deaths per million, this would put our state on track to see over 5,800 people dying from heat-related causes annually, 80 years from now. (In 2019, just over 700 people died from heat-related causes in Texas.)\\n\\nComplications with COVID-19\\nResearch shows that over 80% of those dying from a heat-related cause are over the age of 60. Unfortunately, the same population more susceptible to heat-related illness/death is the same population more susceptible to COVID-19. Given the ongoing pandemic, the concern for the elderly rises as many are forgoing visits or wellness checks in an effort to social distance. In addition, the loss of jobs due to COVID-19 may put a strain on affording utilities like air conditioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "28  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday as the increasing number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases dampened expectations of an economic recovery.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 710.16 points, or 2.7%, to 25,445.94. The S&P 500 closed 2.6% lower at 3,050.33 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 9,909.17. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first daily decline in nine sessions.  It was the worst day for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq since June 11.\\n\\nFlorida said its confirmed cases jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a record, and now total 109,014. The state also said its positivity rate rose to 15.91% from 10.82%. Stocks fell to their session lows after Florida reported its latest case figures.  At one point, the Dow had fallen more than 800 points on Wednesday.\\n\\nCalifornia is one of the states that has also seen a dramatic spike in cases, adding a record of more than 7,000 in one day on Tuesday. In Texas, the Covid-19 number of Covid-19 cases jumped by 5,489. Meanwhile, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ordered visitors from certain hotspot states to quarantine for 14 days.\\n\\n“The latest coronavirus news is not positive for the stock market which was betting the worst of the pandemic recession was behind us,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. “All the hopes of investors looking for a better economy to improve the bottom lines of companies shut down in the recession have been dashed. Forget about the fears of the virus coming back in the fall, the number of new cases and hospitalizations in states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida says the threat is happening right now.”\\n\\nShares of companies primed to benefit from the economy reopening faltered. United Airlines fell 8.3%. Delta, American and Southwest all slid over 7%. Airlines were especially hit by the quarantine orders issued by New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. \\n\\n“It’s definitely the reason for the last leg down. Airline stocks and transports are down, and oil tanked,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “The regional quarantine sparked concerns about a dampening of activity as the economy in the region is just reopening.”\\n\\nCarnival, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean were lower by 11.1%, 12.4% and 11.3%, respectively. Retailer Gap also fell 7.8%. Disney, meanwhile, declined by 3.9% after its Orlando theme-park workers petitioned to postpone the reopening amid the spike in cases in Florida. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "29  SFPD names India Palace attack a hate crime\\nThe Santa Fe Police Department is investigating the recent vandalism at downtown restaurant India Palace as a hate crime and the department \"is aggressively pursuing those responsible for this disgusting display of hatred and intolerance,\" a new release issued Tuesday afternoon stated. Additionally, Deputy Chief Paul Joye tells SFR police are considering possible connections between this incident and the vandalism that defaced the Plaza obelisk. Police believe both crimes occurred in the same time frame overnight on Sunday, June 21. According to Joye, police are collecting surveillance videos from the area, but have not released any information about potential suspects or leads.The FBI also has offered its assistance with the investigation into unlawful entry, criminal damage and vandalism; restaurant owner Bajit Singh made a report with the FBI shortly after discovering the crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
